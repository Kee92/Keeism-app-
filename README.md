# 🌌 Keeley Francis-Chadwick — Architect of Spiritual Interfaces

**Visionary | Technomystic | Creator of Keeism**

Welcome to the digital vault of my work — where code becomes ritual, design channels spirit, and each keystroke contributes to a legacy of spiritual empowerment.

## 🔮 Projects & Practices

- **GEN•O•SIS Deck**  
  A symbolic divination tool blending ritual, prompts, and tech — 100 cards of cosmic clarity and artistic precision.

- **Skeleton Kee App**  
  The interactive codex and engine for Keeism teachings, built to reveal wisdom through dynamic interfaces and intuitive design.

- **Keeism Codex**  
  A JSON-driven sacred archive — complete with alternating button colors, spiritual glyphs, and a UX that mirrors energetic flow.

- **Worksheets & Glyphs**  
  Structuring esoteric wisdom into accessible, interactive formats for all seekers of insight and inner truth.

## 🧬 Philosophy

Keeism is more than a framework — it’s an aesthetic, a ritual, a belief in symbolic structure as a path to power. I build digital experiences that awaken the spiritual self, embolden personal legacy, and invite the universe to play.

## ✨ Let’s Connect
